# Display Firmware

Custom Firmware for 4.3" TJC displays as provided with Elegoo Neptune printers

This utility easily lets you update your display firmware, no SD required! But that isn't it, you can also install fully custom UI skins. 

UI skins can be used to fully customize the UI, but this doesn't extend to just cosmetics. You can also add features to go along with your new UI skins, maybe add support for WLED LED Strips, the choice is yours.
