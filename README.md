### Help Display_firmware

I do not have the time to work on this project anymore. I know this project can be something great if it gets the attention it deserves. The base is there go wild make your own custom UI Themes help out with the base code. I have made a few bits of documentation if you need any help fell free to dm me on discord @ginobeano I will try to help the best I can. Thank you!

# Display_firmware

Custom Firmware for 4.3" TJC displays as provided with Elegoo Neptune printers

This utility easily lets you update your display firmware, no SD required! But that isn't it, you can also install fully custom UI skins. 

UI skins can be used to fully customize the UI, but this doesn't extend to just cosmetics. You can also add features to go along with your new UI skins, maybe add support for WLED LED Strips, the choice is yours.

```
opennept4une
```
